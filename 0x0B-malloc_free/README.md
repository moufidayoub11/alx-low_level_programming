# **0x0B-malloc_free**

This subdirectory is part of the **ALX Low-Level Programming** repository. It contains a series of C programs demonstrating functionalities related to dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and `free`, as part of an **ALX project**.

## **Files**

Here's a brief description of each file in this directory:

1. `0-create_array.c`: Creates an array of characters and initializes it with a specific character.
2. `100-argstostr.c`: Concatenates all the arguments of the program into a single string.
3. `101-strtow.c`: Splits a string into words.
4. `1-strdup.c`: Returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
5. `2-str_concat.c`: Concatenates two strings.
6. `3-alloc_grid.c`: Returns a pointer to a 2D array of integers.
7. `4-free_grid.c`: Frees a 2D array of integers previously created by `3-alloc_grid.c`.

The directory also includes:
- `main.h`: A header file containing the function prototypes used in these programs.

## **Getting Started**

To use these programs:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/moufidayoub11/alx-low_level_programming.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the new subdirectory:
    ```bash
     cd alx-low_level_programming/0x0B-malloc_free
    ```

3. To compile each program, use the following commands:

   - For example, to compile `0-create_array.c`, execute:
     ```bash
     gcc -o create_array 0-create_array.c
     ```
     Then, you can run the program:
     ```bash
     ./create_array
     ```

   - For example, to compile `100-argstostr.c`, execute:
     ```bash
     gcc -o argstostr 100-argstostr.c
     ```
     Then, you can run the program and provide arguments to concatenate:
     ```bash
     ./argstostr argument1 argument2 argument3
     ```

   - Similarly, compile and run the other programs in a similar way.
