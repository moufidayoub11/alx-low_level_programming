# 0x00-hello_world

This subdirectory is part of the ALX Low-Level Programming repository. It contains scripts and programs related to introductory concepts in low-level programming, created as part of the ALX project 0x00-hello_world.

## Scripts and Programs

Below is a list of scripts and programs included in this directory:

1. `0-preprocessor`: A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.
2. `1-compiler`: A script that compiles a C file but does not link.
3. `2-assembler`: A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file.
4. `3-name`: A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
5. `4-puts.c`: A C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line.
6. `5-printf.c`: A C program that prints exactly "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,", followed by a new line.
7. `6-size.c`: A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
8. `100-intel`: A script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file.
9. `101-quote.c`: A C program that prints exactly "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line to the standard error.

## Getting Started

To use these scripts and programs, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/moufidayoub11/alx-low_level_programming.git
```

2. Navigate to the `0x00-hello_world` directory.
```
$ cd alx-low_level_programming/0x00-hello_world
```

3. Choose the script or program you want to run and execute it.
For scripts:
```
$ ./script-name
```
For C programs:
First, compile the C file:
```
$ gcc program-name.c -o program-name
```
Then, run the program:
```
$ ./program-name
```
Note: Replace `script-name` and `program-name` with the actual names of the scripts and programs you want to run.
