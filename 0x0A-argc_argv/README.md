# **0x0A-argc_argv**

This subdirectory is part of the **ALX Low-Level Programming** repository. It contains a series of C programs demonstrating functionalities related to command-line arguments (argc and argv), as part of an **ALX project**.

## **Files**

Here's a brief description of each file in this directory:

1. `0-whatsmyname.c`: Prints the name of the program itself.
2. `100-change.c`: A program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for a given amount.
3. `1-args.c`: Prints the number of arguments passed to the program.
4. `2-args.c`: Prints all the arguments passed to the program.
5. `3-mul.c`: A program that multiplies two numbers.
6. `4-add.c`: A program that adds positive numbers.

## **Getting Started**

To use these programs:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
     git clone https://github.com/moufidayoub11/alx-low_level_programming.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the new subdirectory:
    ```
     cd alx-low_level_programming/0x0A-argc_argv
    ```

3. To compile each program, use the following commands:

   - For example, to compile `0-whatsmyname.c`, execute:
     ```
     gcc -o whatsmyname 0-whatsmyname.c
     ```
     Then, you can run the program:
     ```
     ./whatsmyname
     ```

   - For example, to compile `100-change.c`, execute:
     ```
     gcc -o change 100-change.c
     ```
     Then, you can run the program and provide an amount as an argument:
     ```
     ./change 25
     ```

   - Similarly, compile and run the other programs in a similar way.
