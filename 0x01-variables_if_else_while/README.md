# 0x01-variables_if_else_while

This subdirectory is part of the ALX Low-Level Programming repository. It contains C programs that showcase the use of variables, conditional statements, and loops, as part of the ALX project 0x01-variables_if_else_while.

## Programs

Below is a list of programs included in this directory:

1. `0-positive_or_negative.c`: A program that will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.
2. `1-last_digit.c`: A program that will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.
3. `2-print_alphabet.c`: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
4. `3-print_alphabets.c`: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
5. `4-print_alphabt.c`: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase except `q` and `e`,
6. `5-print_numbers.c`: A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.
7. `6-print_numberz.c`: A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, only using `putchar`, followed by a new line.
8. `7-print_tebahpla.c`: A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
9. `8-print_base16.c`: A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
10. `9-print_comb.c`: A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
11. `100-print_comb3.c`: A program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
12. `101-print_comb4.c`: A program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
13. `102-print_comb5.c`: A program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

## Getting Started

To use these programs, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/moufidayoub11/alx-low_level_programming.git
```

2. Navigate to the `0x01-variables_if_else_while` directory.
```
$ cd alx-low_level_programming/0x01-variables_if_else_while
```

3. Choose the program you want to run and execute it.
First, compile the C file:
```
$ gcc program-name.c -o program-name
```
Then, run the program:
```
$ ./program-name
```
Note: Replace `program-name` with the actual name of the program you want to run.
