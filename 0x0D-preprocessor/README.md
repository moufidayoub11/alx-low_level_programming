# **0x0D-preprocessor**

This subdirectory is part of the **ALX Low-Level Programming** repository. It contains a series of C programs and header files demonstrating the use of preprocessor directives in C programming, as part of an **ALX project**.

## **Files**

Here's a brief description of each file in this directory:

1. `0-object_like_macro.h`: Defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.
2. `1-pi.h`: Defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.
3. `2-main.c`: A simple C program that prints the name of the source file it was compiled from.
4. `3-function_like_macro.h`: Defines a function-like macro named `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.
5. `4-sum.h`: Defines a function-like macro named `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of two numbers `x` and `y`.

## **Getting Started**

To use these programs and header files:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/moufidayoub11/alx-low_level_programming.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the new subdirectory:
    ```
    cd alx-low_level_programming/0x0D-preprocessor
    ```

3. To compile and run `2-main.c`, simply use the following commands:

    ```sh
    gcc -o main 2-main.c
    ./main
    ```

    You should see the name of the source file printed to the console.

4. Similarly, you can include and use the macro definitions from the header files `0-object_like_macro.h`, `1-pi.h`, `3-function_like_macro.h`, and `4-sum.h` in your C programs. Remember to include the appropriate headers using `#include` directive.
